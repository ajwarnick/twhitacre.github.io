<p>This summer I had the awesome opportunity to go on a trip with a group of students from <a href="http://parkerhill.org">our church</a>. The trip is called iPac and last for two weeks. The first part of the trip was a serving part, where the students helped build a home for <a href="http://www.habitatbirmingham.org/">Habitat for Humanity of Greater Birmingham</a>. The second week was spent at a camp in Panama City Beach, Florida called <a href="http://bigstuf.com/">BigStuf</a>.</p>
<p>I had the privilege to join the students for the second week (yes I know... the easy part), but it was still well worth it.</p>
<p>This is yet just another reason as to why I love how my church does student ministry, and am so grateful to be a part of it.</p>
