<p>Ohhhh man, I can't even begin to explain how happy I am right now. Let me give you a little back story...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite a few years ago when I first started getting into the "web business" I needed a registrar. Back then there wasn't too many to choose from and everywhere I looked <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">Go Daddy</a> stood out as not only being the cheapest but being the biggest and most reliable. Back then, that's all I cared about. Since then I've learned that having a good registrar (as well as a webhost) is just as important as having a good mechanic, lawyer or even doctor. They essentially have control over your domain (even though you own it).</p>
<p>A few years ago, I started seeing all the horrible things about <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">Go Daddy</a>. I'm not a big fan of their <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6930045/ns/business/t/ad-godaddy-too-hot-handle/">advertising</a>, not only because it is just something I don't think everyone needs to see (namely children), but they are using sex to sell domain names. It doesn't' even make sense. Aside from that though, I hate that I pay them a good sum of money each year and they still email and call and try to up-sell me around every corner. I know what I'm doing, I bought what I wanted. It's like a Walmart employee following me home to try and sell me catnip when I don't even have a cat. It's just poor business. Then there was the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/bob-parsons-godaddy-ceo-elephant-hunt_n_843121.html">incident</a> involving the owner of the company shooting an elephant for sport. I'm not an animal activist, but I do have respect for the creatures we share the earth with and think the whole thing was just one big publicity stunt. The final thing that pushed me over the edge was <a href="http://godaddyboycott.org/">Go Daddy</a>'s recent show of support in favor of the SOPA bill. I'm not for piracy, but I'm extremely against the SOPA bill and what it stands for.</p>

<p>I've been telling my clients for years to stay away from them and finally last night at 1am, I decided to take my own advice.</p>
<p>I started by transferring my personal domains and then followed that by all my business domains as well. It was time, and I feel very good about it.</p>
