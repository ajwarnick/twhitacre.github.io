title: Barley Helper for Sublime Text
---

<p>It's no&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;that I'm a huge fan of Sublime Text and in fact most of <a href="http://plainmade.com/blog/2740/the-tools-we-use">the team</a>&nbsp;I work with&nbsp;uses it as well. When creating <a href="http://getbarley.com/docs/templates">Barley templates</a>, we wanted a way to make it a little easier.&nbsp;</p><p>I've never created a Sublime Text plugin before, but found it to be fairly easy, especially the nature of this one.</p><p>Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts. If you are a developer looking to create Barley templates, please <a href="http://plainmade.com/blog/25/join-the-barley-farmhand-network">let us know</a>, and hopefully this will make your life a little easier.</p><p>Download Here -&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/twhitacre/Barley-Sublime-Helper">https://github.com/twhitacre/Barley-Sublime-Helper</a></p>
