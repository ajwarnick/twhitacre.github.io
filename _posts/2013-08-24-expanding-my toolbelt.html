title: Expanding My Toolbelt
---

<p>When ever you start a new project it's very important to have the right tools. Today, I decided to tackle one of the many projects that has been looming over my head. Before I got started, I took a step back to figure out which tools I would need. </p><p>When doing a project around the house and realizing I need a tool that I currently don't have, it usually means a trip to Lowes and probably a lot of money. Luckily with the type of development I do, many (if not all) of the tools I need are free.</p><p>Here are a few I got to install today (though to be fair, I've used them all before... just not on this machine)</p><p><a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>, <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> & <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a></p><p><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/OnbSz6kRg262Loaa3avA"><br></p>
