title: Why I Love Trello
---

<p>I'm one of those guys who's always writing down ideas for new projects. Generally these are projects that will push a certain skill of mine to the next level. Sometimes, however they are simply something that I just want to do to for fun with no specific agenda.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/gJOqRfvUQgipO7tYWg8X"><br></p><p>I was looking for an easy way to organize these "projects" and tried about every free version of a project management tool I could find. In the end, I came back to <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>. It has served me well in the past and to be honest, I'm not really sure why I didn't go with it in the first place. After about an hour of setting up a new board, I'm happy to say I've been able to not only organize my personal projects, but also prioritize them as well.</p>
