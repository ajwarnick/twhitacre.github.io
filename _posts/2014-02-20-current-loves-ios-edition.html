<p>Well, it’s finally starting to warm up here in Northeast PA and I’m neck deep in finishing a soon to be released update to <a href="https://twitter.com/unmarkit" target="_blank">Unmark</a> (formerly nilai.co).</p><p>I get asked quite often by friends what are the most used apps on my iPhone. I thought this would be a great place to share them.<br></p><p>The image below is a screenshot of my actual home screen on my iPhone 5. I’ve had it this way for probably the last 6 months and don’t plan to change anytime soon. Although with the thousands of app developers out there… that could change tomorrow.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of some of my favorite apps.</p><p>    <img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6EeMF8uORle55vGcbtrr" width="280" class="left"></p><p>Photo App - <a href="http://campl.us/" target="_blank">Camera Plus</a><br>Browser - <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/mobile/ios.html" target="_blank">Chrome for iOS</a><br>Weather - <a href="http://checktheweather.co/" target="_blank">Check the Weather</a><br>Lists - <a href="http://www.anylistapp.com/" target="_blank">AnyList</a><br>Reader - <a href="https://getpocket.com/ios/" target="_blank">Pocket</a><br>Pod Catcher - <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a><br>Music - <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rdio/id335060889" target="_blank">Rdio</a><br>News - <a href="http://flyosity.com/interesting/" target="_blank">Interesting</a><br>Mail - Default<br>Calendar - Default<br></p><p>I also do keep up on some social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare and thus they landed a spot on my home screen. </p><p>There are also many others I didn’t mention.
