<p>I should probably be more worried about what I'm going to get my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com/">wife</a> today, but I also wanted to take time out to announce the launch of the first ever online web app that I was able to be a part of.</p>
<p>It's called <a href="http://hostednotes.com">Hosted Notes</a> and it's tool to help keep track of passwords. It was originally concieved with freelances in mind. When doing a website for a client, you usually end up with many different passwords and programs you need access to. With Hosted Notes you can keep track of all of them in one simple secure place.</p>
<p>I believe we'll be launching more features over time, but feel free to check it out ant let me know what you think!</p>
