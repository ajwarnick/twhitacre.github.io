<p>Life tends to stay pretty hectic.... and I rarely have time to pick up new projects. However, when a good friend approached me with a new idea a month or so back, I knew I would be a fool not to go for it.</p>
<p>I won't go into too much detail as of yet... but basically I'll say this:</p>
<p>EVERYONE eats produce... from one place or another and with all the new technology out there, the produce game is changing. We recognize that and also see an opportunity to create a product that will help make the lives of both consumers and growers better. You could say we are bridging a gap between the grower and the consumer.</p>
<p>We'll be releasing more details later but in the meantime though, enjoy this picture of some homemade sauce we made while discussing the product and be sure to check out our website - <a href="http://producebrands.com">http://producebrands.com</a></p>
