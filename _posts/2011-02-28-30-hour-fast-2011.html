<p>I consider myself luck that over the past 3 years I've been able to be a part of <a href="http://www.parkerhill.org/">Parker Hill</a> and their student ministries department. Over this last weekend I was able to take part in what is called the <a href="http://www.parkerhill.org/youthportal/?page_id=13">30 hour fast</a>. Basically all of the students from middle school to high school raise money and awareness by giving up their right to eat for 30 hours.</p>
<p>Here's a clip of the highlight video:</p>
