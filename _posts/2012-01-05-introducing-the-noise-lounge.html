<p>So, now that I'm done ranting about <a title="Goodbye Go Daddy!" href="http://timw.co/good-bye-go-daddy/">Godaddy</a> and all of the nonsense going on over there, I decided to focus my efforts on something more positive. Over the holiday break (I took a few days off), I decided to put the finishing touch on a website I'd been wanting to launch for some time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-245" title="The Noise Lounge" src="http://timw.co/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/logo.png" alt="" width="332" height="66" /></p>
<p>A few months back, I reached out to some friends who share a similar interest in music but were not completely satisfied with the current sites out there. After figuring everything out and getting one of the <a href="http://kyleruane.com">best web designers</a> alive to help me design a logo, I set to work on the actual meat of the site.</p>
<p>On Friday, December 30, I pushed the big publish button and <a href="http://thenoiselounge.com">The Noise Lounge</a> went live.</p>
<p>Take a look... tell me what you think...</p>
